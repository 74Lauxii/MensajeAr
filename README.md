# MensajeAr
MensajeAr is a simple real-time messaging application. It’s built with basic HTML and CSS, since the focus is on the backend, which is developed using Node.js. Finally, the database is built using MySQL Workbench. Inside the folder, you’ll find the tables needed to set up your database and install the necessary dependencies.
I hope you enjoy MensajeAr!
